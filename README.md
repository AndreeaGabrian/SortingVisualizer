This visualizer aminates different sorting algorithms. You can chose the algorithm, the array length(from 10 to 800 elements) and also the animation speed.
For each sorting algorithm it is diplayed the time complexity.

Options:

  -> generate new random array configuration
  
  -> start animation
  
  -> stop animation
  
  -> resume animation
  
The graphic component was created with JavaFx
